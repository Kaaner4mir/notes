    <h2>What is an SSD?</h2>

    <hr size="4" color="gray">

    <p>An SSD, or <b>solid-state drive</b>, is a type of storage device used in computers. This non-volatile storage
        media
        stores persistent data on solid-state flash memory. SSDs replace traditional hard disk drives (HDDs) in
        computers and perform the same basic functions as a hard drive. But SSDs are significantly faster in comparison.
        With an SSD, the device's operating system will boot up more rapidly, programs will load quicker and files can
        be saved faster.
    </p>

    <p>A traditional hard drive consists of a spinning disk with a read/write head on a mechanical arm called an
        actuator. An HDD reads and writes data magnetically. The magnetic properties, however, can lead to mechanical
        breakdowns.
    </p>

    <p>
        By comparison, an SSD has no moving parts to break or spin up or down. The two key components in an SSD are the
        flash controller and <u>NAND</u> flash memory chips. This configuration is optimized to deliver high read/write
        performance for sequential and random data requests.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 50px;">
        SSDs are used anywhere that hard drives can be deployed. In consumer products, for example, they are used in
        personal computers (PCs), laptops, computer games, digital cameras, digital music players, smartphones, tablets
        and thumb drives. They are also incorporated with graphics cards. However, they are more expensive than
        traditional HDDs.
    </p>

    <p>
        Businesses with a rapidly expanding need for higher input/output (I/O) have fueled the development and adoption
        of SSDs. <span style="background-color: yellow; color: purple;">Because SSDs offer lower latency than HDDs, they
            can efficiently handle both heavy read and
            random
            workloads.</span> That lower latency stems from the ability of a flash SSD to read data directly and
        immediately from
        stored data.
    </p>

    <p>
        High-performance servers, laptops, desktops or any application that needs to deliver information in real-time
        can benefit from solid-state drive technology. Those characteristics make enterprise SSDs suitable to offload
        reads from transaction-heavy databases. They can also help to alleviate boot storms with virtual desktop
        infrastructure, or inside a storage array to store frequently used data locally using a hybrid cloud.
    </p>

    <p>
        Systems such as high-performance servers, laptops, and desktops — or any environment requiring real-time data
        delivery — gain substantial advantages from SSD technology. These drives enable enterprise systems to reduce
        read
        loads on busy databases and improve performance during intense startup activity in virtual desktop
        infrastructures.
        In addition, SSDs are often used within storage arrays to keep frequently accessed data close to processing
        units,
        particularly in hybrid cloud setups.

    <h2 align="left">How do SSDs work?</h2>

    <hr size="4" color="gray">

    <p>
        <span style="background-color:orange;color:blue;">An SSD reads and writes data to underlying interconnected
            flash memory chips made out of silicon.
            Manufacturers build SSDs by stacking chips in a grid to achieve different densities.
        </span>
    </p>

    <p>
        SSDs read and write data to an underlying set of interconnected flash memory chips. These chips use floating
        gate transistors (FGTs) to hold an electrical charge, which enables the SSD to store data even when it is not
        connected to a power source. Each FGT contains a single bit of data, designated either as a 1 for a charged cell
        or a 0 if the cell has no electrical charge.
    </p>

    

    <p>
        <u>Every block of data is accessible at a consistent speed. However, SSDs can only write to empty blocks. And
        although SSDs have tools to get around this, performance may still slow over time.</u>
    </p>

    <p>
        SSDs use three main types of memory: single-, multi- and triple-level cells. Single-level cells can hold one bit
        of data at a time -- a one or zero. Single-level cells (SLCs) are the most expensive form of SSD, but are also
        the fastest and most durable. Multi-level cells (MLCs) can hold two bits of data per cell and have a larger
        amount of storage space in the same amount of physical space as a SLC. However, MLCs have slower write speeds.
        Triple-level cells (TLCs) can hold three bits of data in a cell. Although TLCs are cheaper, they also have
        slower write speeds and are less durable than other memory types. TLC-based SSDs deliver more flash capacity and
        are less expensive than an MLC or SLC, albeit with a higher likelihood for bit rot due to having eight states
        within the cell.

    <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">What are the advantages of SSDs?</h3>

    <hr size="4" color="gray">

    <ul style="color: green;line-height: 60px;">
        <li><b>Quicker boot times and better performance: </b>Because the drive does not need to spin up as an HDD
            would, it is more responsive and provides better load performance.
        </li>
        <li><b>Durability: </b>SSDs are more shock-resistant and can handle heat better than HDDs because they do not
            have moving parts.</li>
        <li><b>Power consumption: </b>SSDs need less power to operate than HDDs due to their lack of moving parts.</li>
        <li><b>Quieter: </b>SSDs produce less audible noise because there are no moving or spinning parts.</li>
        <li><b>Size: </b>SSDs come in a variety of form factors whereas HDD sizes are limited.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>What are the disadvantages of SSDs?</h3>

<hr size="4" color="gray">

<ul style="color: red;line-height: 60px;">
    <li><b>Cost:</b> SSDs are more expensive than traditional HDDs.</li>
    <li><b>Life expectancy:</b> Some SSDs, for example, those using NAND memory-flash chips, can only be written a
        specified number of times
        that is typically less than HDDs.</li>
    <li><b>Performance:</b> Limitations on the number of write cycles cause SSDs to decrease in performance over time.
    </li>
    <li><b>Storage options:</b> Because of cost, SSDs are typically sold in smaller sizes.</li>
    <li><b>Data recovery: </b>This time-consuming process can be expensive, as the data on damaged chips may not be recoverable.</li>
</ul>
